# Netflix Data Analytics Project

This project showcases comprehensive SQL queries and techniques applied to analyze the Netflix dataset. The analysis provides insights into Netflix's content library, such as movie vs. TV show distribution, most common ratings, top-performing countries, and much more. Below is a summary of the queries and findings:

## Project Overview

* **Dataset**: Netflix content library dataset including attributes like type, title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and more.
* **Objective**: Perform analytical queries to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Key Insights and Features

1. **Movies vs. TV Shows**:

   * Counted the distribution of content types to identify the dominance of movies or TV shows.

2. **Most Common Ratings**:

   * Analyzed the most frequent ratings for both movies and TV shows.

3. **Year-Specific Content**:

   * Listed all movies released in a given year (e.g., 2020).

4. **Top Countries**:

   * Identified the top 5 countries producing the most content on Netflix.

5. **Longest Movie**:

   * Found the longest movie based on its duration.

6. **Recent Additions**:

   * Filtered content added to Netflix in the past 5 years.

7. **Director-Specific Content**:

   * Listed movies/TV shows directed by specific individuals (e.g., Rajiv Chilaka).

8. **Genre Analysis**:

   * Counted the number of content items in each genre.

9. **Content Without Directors**:

   * Identified content missing director information.

10. **Actor Analytics**:

    * Highlighted the most frequent actors in Indian-produced content and specific actor appearances.

11. **Keyword Categorization**:

    * Classified content as "Bad" (keywords: "Kill" or "Violence") or "Good" based on descriptions.

## Tools Used

* **SQL**: PostgreSQL was used for querying and analysis.
* **Dataset**: Publicly available Netflix dataset.

## Learnings

This project enhanced my skills in:

* Complex SQL queries: `WITH` clauses, window functions, and aggregate functions.
* Data wrangling: Handling nested and missing values using `unnest` and conditional logic.
* Insights generation: Delivering actionable insights from raw data.

## Future Improvements

* Integrate visualizations for better understanding of insights.
* Automate report generation using Python and SQL integration.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest enhancements to this project.
